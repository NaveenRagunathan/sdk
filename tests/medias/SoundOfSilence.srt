00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,630
Hello darkness, my old friend

1
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,730
I've come to talk with you again

2
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,930
Because a vision softly creeping

3
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,830
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

4
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:53,030
And the vision that was
planted in my brain

5
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:01,730
Still remains within the sound
of silence

6
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,430
In restless dreams I walked alone

7
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,530
Narrow streets of cobblestone

8
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,030
'Neath the halo of a street lamp

9
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,130
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

10
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,030
When my eyes were stabbed

11
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,130
By the flash of a neon light

12
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,630
That split the night

13
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,730
And touched the sound of silence

14
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,430
And in the ***** light I saw

15
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,630
Ten thousand people, maybe more

16
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:05,330
People talking without speaking

17
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,030
People hearing without listening

18
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,730
People writing songs

19
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,030
That voices never share

20
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,230
And no one dare

21
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,430
Disturb the sound of silence

22
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,930
"Fools," said I, "you do not know

23
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,730
Silence, like a cancer, grows.

24
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,030
Hear my words that I might teach you

25
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,530
Take my arms that I might reach you."

26
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:00,730
But my words like silent raindrops fell

27
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:11,130
And echoed in the wells of silence

28
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,530
And the people bowed and prayed

29
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,330
To the neon God they made

30
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,030
And the sign flashed out its warning

31
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,330
And the words that it was forming

32
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,130
And the sign said,

33
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,930
Are written on the subway walls

34
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,030
And tenement halls."

35
00:03:46,730 --> 00:04:00,730
And whispered in the sound of silence
